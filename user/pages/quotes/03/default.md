The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena... In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves... The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand... It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
